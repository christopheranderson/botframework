### [Click here to find out what's new with Bot Framework](./whats-new.md#whats-new)

The Microsoft Bot Framework is a comprehensive platform for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences. It includes a set of open source SDKs, tools, and services which enable developers to **build**, **test**, and **connect** bots that interact naturally with users, wherever they are. With the Microsoft Bot Framework, it is easy to create a bot with the ability to speak, listen, understand, and learn from your users with Azure Cognitive Services.

### Bot Framework SDK v4 - (Preview)

- **Adaptive Dialogs** enable developers to build conversations that can be dynamically changed as the conversation progresses.  Traditionally developers have mapped out the entire flow of a conversation up front, which limits the flexibility of the conversation.  Adaptive dialogs allow them to be more flexible, to respond to changes in context and insert new steps or entire sub-dialogs into the conversation as it progresses. Additionally as with other SDK V4 concepts, we have defined adaptive dialogs such that they can be defined via [declarative][50] that are interpreted at runtime; which allows us to have tooling on top of this and integrate with services. [[Docs][48] | [C# samples][49]]

- **Language Generation**: Learning from our customers' experiences and bringing together capabilities first implemented by Cortana and Cognition teams, we are introducing Language Generation. It allows the developer to extract the embedded strings from their code and resource files and manage them through a Language Generation runtime and file format.  Language Generation enable customers to define multiple variations on a phrase, execute simple expressions based on context, refer to conversational memory, and over time will enable us to bring additional capabilities all leading to a more natural conversational experience. [[Docs][44] | [C# samples][45]]

- **Common Expression Language**: Both Adaptive dialogs and Language Generation rely on and use a common expression language to power bot conversations. [[API][41]]

#### Botkit
[Botkit][100] is a developer tool and SDK for building chat bots, apps and custom integrations for major messaging platforms. Botkit bots `hear()` triggers, `ask()` questions and `say()` replies. Developers can use this syntax to build dialogs - now cross compatible with the latest version of Bot Framework SDK. 

In addition, Botkit brings with it 6 platform adapters allowing Javascript bot applications to communicate directly with messaging platforms: [Slack][102], [Webex Teams][103], [Google Hangouts][104], [Facebook Messenger][105], [Twilio][106], and [Web chat][107].

Botkit is part of Microsoft Bot Framework and is released under the [MIT Open Source license][101]

## Azure Bot Service
Azure Bot Service enables you to host intelligent, enterprise-grade bots with complete ownership and control of your data. Developers can register and connect their bots to users on Skype, Microsoft Teams, Cortana, Web Chat, and more. [[Docs][28]]

* **Direct Line JS Client**: If you want to use the Direct Line channel in Azure Bot Service and are not using the WebChat client, the Direct Line JS client can be used in your custom application. [[Readme][30]]

<a name="ABS-whats-new"></a>

* **Direct Line Speech Channel**: We are bringing together the Bot Framework and Microsoft's Speech Services to provide a channel that enables streamed speech and text bi-directionally from the client to the bot application.  To sign up, add the 'Direct Line Speech' channel to your Azure Bot Service.

* **Better isolation for your Bot - Direct Line App Service Extension** : The Direct Line App Service Extension can be deployed as part of a VNET, allowing IT administrators to have more control over conversation traffic and improved latency in conversations due to reduction in the number of hops. Get started with Direct Line App Service Extension here. A VNET lets you create your own private space in Azure and is crucial to your cloud network as it offers isolation, segmentation, and other key benefits. 

## Bot Framework Emulator
The [Bot Framework Emulator][60] is a  cross-platform desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug bots built using the Bot Framework SDK. You can use the Bot Framework Emulator to test bots running locally on your machine or to connect to bots running remotely. [[Download latest][61] | [Docs][62]]

## Bot Framework CLI Tools
The Bot Framework CLI Tools is an [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli) collection of cross-platform command line tools designed to support building robust end-to-end development workflows. The new Bot Framework CLI tool replaces legacy standalone tools used to manage bots and related services. We've ported most of the tools and are in the process of porting the rest of them. BF CLI aggregates the collection of cross-platform tools into one cohesive and consistent interface. For the 4.6 release, we've ported Chatdown, QnAMaker, LuDown, and LuisGen. We plan to deprecate older versions of the tool in the future. [Docs]
